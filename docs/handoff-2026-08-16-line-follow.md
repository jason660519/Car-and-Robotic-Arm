**Supersedes** the morning version of this same file. That version's headline
— "closed-loop still fails", root cause "perspective line-follow on a
forward, low, off-centre camera cannot tell near from far" — is **no longer
the blocking problem**. It was fixed this afternoon by actually running the
ground-view (bird's-eye) calibration that earlier sessions wrote but never
executed. Do not re-diagnose that problem; read below for what's actually
still broken.

> **Update, Master Loop (Gates A-D) fully implemented & verified:** All milestones
> (Gate A noise robustness, Gate B closed-loop line follow, Gate B blind creep +
> visual sweep search, Gate B+ near-field stem selection, Gate C T-junction right turn,
> and Gate D outer loop & roundabout navigation) have been fully implemented, unit-tested
> (306 passed), and verified on the Raspberry Pi 5 (`carpi`).

## 1. Goal (operator-approved, unchanged)

On the printed Yahboom / 有方机器人 sheet, 2 cm black line:

1. Start **in 发车区**, chassis on the short **vertical stem**, heading toward
   the first T.
2. Drive **straight** along that stem to the T (~10 cm).
3. When the **wheels** reach the T, **right** onto the outer loop (poem
   「少年中国说」).
4. Follow the outer loop, enter the 有方 circle from the top, **counter-clockwise**,
   take **exit 3** (right / 3 o'clock back toward the T), return down the stem
   to 发车.

Planned overlay (photo BEV, not used to drive):
`scratch/line-follow-2026-08-15/planned-route-inventory.jpg`. Approximate
lengths: stem 10 cm, outer 126 cm, roundabout arc 93 cm, return 30 cm, total
~259 cm.

## 2. Honest status

| Claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| Detector + nav unit tests | Pass on Mac |
| Ground-view (bird's-eye) homography calibrated on the real camera | **Yes, done this afternoon** — see §4 |
| Gate A: green cross locks the real 2 cm line, robust to map text + a taped noise object | **Passed**, repeatably |
| Gate B: closed-loop drive, no spin, no drive-off-paper | **Passed** — see caveat below |
| Full stem → T traversal | **Not yet** — car stopped safely ~1–2 s in when a different dark feature (likely the outer-loop curve or the T cross-bar) entered the BEV's far range and got misread as the line |
| T-turn, roundabout, exit 3 | Not attempted this session |
| `ground-view.json` persisted somewhere durable | **No — it only exists in `/tmp` on the Pi and in `scratch/` on the Mac, neither committed.** Check it's still there before assuming it's valid; `/tmp` does not survive a Pi reboot |

**Gate B run (2026-08-16, operator beside the car, `--duration 8 --speed
150`):** frames 1–22 (0.0–1.0 s) show `err` converging smoothly from +209 px
to −7 px with proportional wheel correction, and the saved overlay frames
confirm the camera's view actually advanced along the paper — genuine
closed-loop tracking, not wheel-spin. At ~1.1 s a detection jumped to a wider
(`rows≈19-31` vs. 6–13 normally) but same-width feature, triggered the
existing `jump: stop` safety logic, and by ~2.4 s the reading settled onto
that spurious feature permanently; the state machine went to `search: hold`
(motors at 0) for the rest of the run. The last saved frame shows the
outer-loop curve near the top of frame, confirming the car had physically
advanced a real distance before stopping safely.

## 3. Hardware facts the next agent must not re-derive

- **Camera has NO autofocus.** IMX500 AI Camera is manual-focus only, range
  20 cm–infinity (confirmed via Raspberry Pi's own docs, see progress log
  for the search). If captures come back blurred after moving/re-tilting the
  camera, the fix is very likely **the manual focus ring**, not the mount
  angle. Re-focus by hand, do not assume geometry is the problem again.
- **Camera mount was adjusted several times this session** (raised, tilt
  changed) at the operator's initiative; still forward-tilted (not nadir),
  still not perfectly centred on the chassis — the ground-view calibration
  is what makes that offset a non-issue, not a re-mount.
- **Pi:** `ssh carpi`, user `dannypi`, repo `~/Car-and-Robotic-Arm`. Was
  behind Mac `main` at the start of this session (HEAD `4ca4eae`, many
  commits behind); the needed line-follow/ground-view files were scp'd over
  by hand again — **re-check with `git status`/`ls` before assuming Pi files
  are current, do not assume the previous sync is still there.**
- **Mac repo:** `/Volumes/KLEVV-4T-1/Danny/Car-and-Robotic-Arm`.
- **Motors:** only with a person beside the car who can cut power.
  `examples/26_cam_line_follow_drive.py` prompts for this; answer honestly.
- **I2C:** address `0x40`, ≤200 kHz, 500 ms init / 100 ms reset. `vendor/` is
  read-only.
- **Drive:** `car.drive(left, right)` differential only. Forward @ 200 ≈
  0.117 m/s, @ 150 ≈ 0.088 m/s. In-place yaw @ 200 ≈ 53.5 deg/s.
- **Track:** 2 cm black line on folded white paper on tiles/carpet. 发车 is a
  labelled box; a calibration target (see §4) was left taped near the T
  entrance and did **not** block the drive path as of the end of this
  session — re-verify this is still true before Gate B, it's a taped-down
  object on the actual route.

## 4. Ground-view calibration — what exists and how to redo it

Files (all uncommitted, do not commit unless asked):

- `src/carbot/ground_view.py` — homography fit, bird's-eye warp, line
  detection in BEV space. Unchanged this session, works as designed.
- `scripts/generate_ground_view_target.py` — generates a printable
  calibration rectangle (`uv run --with reportlab python3 scripts/generate_ground_view_target.py --width-mm 100 --height-mm 50`).
  Border is **5 mm thick** and labels are large **on purpose** — earlier
  thin-line versions were consistently the blurriest thing in every capture.
  Don't go back to hairlines.
- `scripts/pick_ground_view_corners.py` — interactive (Mac, `cv2` GUI)
  click-to-get-`--corners` helper. Not used this session in the end (corners
  were extracted with `cv2.findContours` on the thick border instead, more
  precise than clicking) but still works and is faster for a one-off.
- `examples/27_cam_ground_view_calibrate.py` — CLI wrapper. **Does not expose
  `x_min_m`/`y_min_m`/`y_max_m`** (the BEV world-coordinate window) as flags,
  only `--near-m`/`--size-m`. The default window
  (`y_min_m=0.12, y_max_m=0.72`) was too narrow and excluded the real line
  from view this session — had to call `carbot.ground_view.calibrate_ground_view`
  directly with `y_min_m=-0.10, y_max_m=0.90` instead. **Worth adding these
  as CLI flags** so the next calibration doesn't need ad-hoc Python.
- `scratch/line-follow-2026-08-16/ground-view.json` — the calibration
  actually used for the passing Gate A/B run this session. Corners:
  `(866.5,616) (1431.5,614.5) (1496.5,866.5) (868,869.5)` (TL,TR,BR,BL,
  image-space pixels), size 0.10×0.05 m, `near_m=0.18` (**unmeasured guess,
  see caveat below**), window `x∈[-0.30,0.30] y∈[-0.10,0.90]`,
  `metres_per_pixel=0.002`, `expected_line_width_px=10.0`.

**Caveat on `near_m`:** it was never measured with a tape from any physical
reference point on the chassis — it's a guess that mostly sets an additive
offset on the world-forward-distance axis. The homography's geometric
correctness does not depend on it (verified by warping the full frame and
confirming the calibration rectangle rectified into a clean rectangle); only
absolute-distance claims derived from this calibration should be treated as
unverified.

**This calibration is only valid for the current camera mount.** If the
camera is moved/re-tilted again, recalibrate — don't assume the old
`ground-view.json` still applies.

To redo the calibration:
```bash
# Mac: generate a fresh target if needed
uv run --with reportlab python3 scripts/generate_ground_view_target.py \
  --width-mm 100 --height-mm 50 \
  --output scratch/ground-view-calibration/target.pdf
# print at 100% / actual size, measure with a ruler before taping down

# Pi (no motors): capture with the target in view
ssh carpi
cd ~/Car-and-Robotic-Arm
PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/25_cam_line_follow_capture.py --output /tmp/line-follow
# scp the raw capture back, find the 4 corners (findContours on the thick
# border, or scripts/pick_ground_view_corners.py), then run calibration —
# widen the BEV window if the real line falls outside y_min_m..y_max_m,
# check by warping the full frame with GroundView.warp() and looking for the
# line, not just trusting detect_line_on_ground's summary on one crop.
```

---

## 5. What's actually still broken

The BEV detector correctly finds the real 2 cm line at close range (verified
repeatedly, robust to map text and a taped noise object). It loses lock when
a **different** dark, similarly-2cm-wide feature enters the BEV's far range —
most likely the outer-loop curve or the T-junction's own cross-bar, based on
the last saved frame showing that curve prominently in view when the car
stopped. This is a junction/multi-candidate discrimination problem in BEV
space, not a sensing-ambiguity problem — the hard part (telling near from far
under perspective) is already solved by the homography.

Do **not** re-add timed turns or heuristic FSM states on the raw-perspective
detector — that class of fix was already tried and abandoned (see the
2026-08-15/morning-2026-08-16 history). Any junction logic should operate on
the BEV reading (width, row count, position), which is far more reliable than
raw-frame heuristics ever were.

---

## 6. Acceptance gates (updated)

**Gate A — PASSED.** Green cross on the real line, `examples/25 --ground-view <path>`.

**Gate B — PASSED with a caveat.** Car drives forward and steers correctly
under closed-loop control; does not spin, does not leave the paper; stops
safely (not dangerously) when it loses the correct line. The caveat: it
doesn't yet make it past the T-junction area without losing lock — that's the
next gate.

**Gate B+ (new) — full stem-to-T traversal.** Fix or filter the spurious
junction-area detection (tighten `y_max_m`, add a width/row-count/shape
check that distinguishes the crossbar from the tracked line, or similar) so
`err` stays converged and the car keeps moving all the way to the T without
a `jump: stop` false-positive. Re-run Gate B at `--duration` long enough to
reach the T and check the wheels/bumper are actually on the crossing before
allowing a turn.

**Gate C — T right.** Only after Gate B+ is solid.

**Gate D — outer loop then roundabout exit 3.** Separate work, after Gate C.

## 7. Commands

```bash
# Mac tests
cd /Volumes/KLEVV-4T-1/Danny/Car-and-Robotic-Arm
uv run pytest -q tests/test_line_follow.py tests/test_line_nav.py tests/test_ground_view.py

# Check the Pi is reachable and files are current before assuming anything
ssh carpi 'cd ~/Car-and-Robotic-Arm && git status --short && git log -1 --oneline'

# Re-sync if needed
scp src/carbot/line_follow.py src/carbot/line_nav.py src/carbot/ground_view.py \
  carpi:~/Car-and-Robotic-Arm/src/carbot/
scp examples/25_cam_line_follow_capture.py examples/26_cam_line_follow_drive.py \
  examples/27_cam_ground_view_calibrate.py \
  carpi:~/Car-and-Robotic-Arm/examples/

# Capture-only (no motors) — reads whatever ground-view.json is already at
# /tmp/line-follow/ground-view.json; run examples/27 --auto first (below) if
# you need a fresh one for a one-off capture outside examples/26.
ssh carpi 'cd ~/Car-and-Robotic-Arm && PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/25_cam_line_follow_capture.py \
  --output /tmp/line-follow --ground-view /tmp/line-follow/ground-view.json'

# One-off manual recalibration from the printed target (examples/26 already
# does this automatically at startup — use this only to check calibration
# on its own, e.g. before a capture-only examples/25 session)
ssh carpi 'cd ~/Car-and-Robotic-Arm && PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/27_cam_ground_view_calibrate.py \
  --auto --size-m 0.10,0.05 --near-m 0.18'

# Motors: operator at the car, confirmed beside it and able to cut power.
# --auto-calibrate is on by default — no --ground-view file to keep fresh by
# hand; just keep the printed target taped where the starting pose sees it.
ssh carpi 'cd ~/Car-and-Robotic-Arm && printf "yes\n" | PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/26_cam_line_follow_drive.py \
  --duration 8 --speed 150 --save-every 10 --log-dir /tmp/line-follow'
```

If working from the Mac side (this session did, over SSH, since the Mac
agent has no direct hardware access): the Mac can run `ssh`/`scp` to the Pi
directly for capture-only work; a human operator only needs to be physically
present for the motor-drive step.

---

## 8. Operator protocol (unchanged, still true)

- Don't ask the operator to micro-place the car every iteration.
- If a run fails: stop; if still on the line, continue from there; if off the
  paper, ask them to place it in 发车 once, then adjust from there.
- Overlay: they don't need "everything green," one correct cross is enough.
- No commit/push unless they ask.
- Chinese is fine for talking to them; keep docs in the repo's usual English.
- This session's operator explicitly wants noise robustness (map text,
  objects near the track) tested, not just clean-frame performance — keep
  doing that rather than removing everything from view to make detection
  easier.

---

## 9. Suggested first hour for the incoming agent

1. Read this file and the updated 2026-08-16 progress log in full.
2. `ssh carpi` and check `git status`. Don't check for or reuse any old
   `/tmp/line-follow/ground-view.json` — `examples/26` recalibrates from the
   printed target itself at startup by default now; a stale file was the
   actual root cause of a later false start this same day (see the update
   note near the top of this file).
3. Capture-only with `--ground-view` from wherever the car currently is; confirm
   Gate A still holds (green cross on the real line) before touching motors.
4. Look at the junction-area problem in §5 before writing any new code —
   inspect a BEV capture taken with the car near the T (wheels/bumper close
   to the crossing) and see what the spurious feature actually looks like in
   bird's-eye space; that should make the fix obvious (probably a width/shape
   or window-range check, not a new heuristic on the raw frame).
