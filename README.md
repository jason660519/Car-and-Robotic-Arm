- Runnable Python checks for bring-up, motor mapping, and basic driving
- A bilingual project site for browsing parts and build progress

## Current Status

2. Browse the project website: [Live Site](https://jason660519.github.io/Car-and-Robotic-Arm/)

```

The chassis and arm are controlled by the **Yourfun NeZha bus driver board**. A Raspberry Pi 5
communicates with the board over I2C at address `0x40` to drive four DC motors, four servo
channels, the onboard LEDs, and optional encoder inputs.

The board ships with Arduino, STM32, and C51 driver code and no protocol specification. This
project has no microcontroller, so the command set was reconstructed from those three vendor SDKs
and reimplemented in Python against the Pi's hardware I2C — see
[ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-nezha-python-driver-port.md) for the decision and its translation
tradeoffs, and [docs/hardware/nezha-i2c-protocol.md](docs/hardware/nezha-i2c-protocol.md) for the
resulting command reference.

## SSH Access to Raspberry Pi 5

The Raspberry Pi is configured for key-based authentication. Connect via SSH alias:

```bash
ssh carpi
```

or explicitly:

```bash
ssh dannypi@danny-raspberrypi5-8gram-225gssd.local
```

**Authentication:** Ed25519 key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`), not password.  
**User:** `dannypi`  
**Hostname:** `danny-raspberrypi5-8gram-225gssd.local` (mDNS, requires local network)

After connecting, navigate to the project:

```bash
cd /Volumes/KLEVV-4T-1/Danny/Car-and-Robotic-Arm
```

or if that's not mounted, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jason660519/Car-and-Robotic-Arm.git
cd Car-and-Robotic-Arm
uv sync
```

## Quick Start

Run the examples in order. Scripts `01`, `05`-`06`, `08`, and `12`-`15` are safe to run over SSH
(no motors or servos move); motor-moving scripts (`02`-`04`, `07`, `09`-`11`) require an operator
standing beside the robot who can cut main power instantly. Run `14` before any motion test.

Script names are `NN_<tool>_<function>.py`, so the filename tells you which hardware it drives —
`cam` (IMX500), `sonar` (HC-SR04), `ir` (IR tracing sensor), `motor`, `servo`, `i2c`, `power`. See
[CONVENTIONS.md §3.6](CONVENTIONS.md#36-runnable-scripts-in-examples-nn_tool_function_modepy).

Expected results (verified on this build, 2026-08):

- `01` prints `✓ Probe finished successfully`.
- `02` runs each motor forward then reverse for 1 s; all four wheels move, matching
  `src/carbot/config.py` (`M1`=rear-left, `M2`=rear-right, `M3`=front-right, `M4`=front-left,
  `INVERTED_MOTORS={2, 3}`).
- `03` performs a short low-speed differential-drive run.
- `04` sweeps each arm servo through a small range with the operator watching.
- `05` prints `All checks passed` and (with `--photo`) writes `/tmp/ai-camera-check.jpg`.
- `06` prints an average distance in cm and warns when it drops below the obstacle threshold.
- `07` prints one `clear`/`OBSTACLE` decision per loop; `--dry-run` never drives motors.
- `08` prints `✓ Power health OK.` when `EXT5V_V >= 4.8 V` with no **live** throttle bits.
  In `get_throttled` the low nibble (`0x1`/`0x2`/`0x4`/`0x8`) is the live state and bits
  16-19 (`0x10000`+) are sticky since-boot history. Only a live bit means fix the power
  supply before motor tests; a since-boot bit prints as `[INFO]` because it stays set
  until reboot.
- `21` reports `Use mode 'single' in the fused patrol.` — the IMX500 delivers inference
  frames and 2028×1520 stills from one configuration, so no mode switching is needed.
  Its exposure sweep ranks settings by *repeatable* keypoints (matched across two captures
  of the same scene), not raw counts, because analogue gain manufactures keypoints out of
  sensor noise: `ev+1.5` reports 21% more raw keypoints than the default at gain 15.5 while
  matching fewer of them. `long-shutter+spot` wins at gain 4.0, but its 97 ms shutter still
  has to be proven sharp on a car that has only just stopped.
- `22 --dry-run` reads the sonar and the detector and prints one fused `clear`/`BLOCKED`
  decision per step without sending any motor command. Raise `--obstacle-cm` above the
  measured distance to exercise the sonar branch, or lower `--threshold` to exercise the
  vision branch, before any supervised run.
- `12` detects AprilTag ID 0 using its measured 70 mm black square and writes annotated and
  undistorted images under `/tmp`.
- `13` requires the measured, fixed wall targets documented in
  [`docs/progress/2026-08-14-vision-room-anchor.md`](docs/progress/2026-08-14-vision-room-anchor.md),
  then writes `/tmp/room-pose.json` and `/tmp/room-pose.jpg`.

## Working From a Mac

The code runs on the Raspberry Pi, not on your laptop — only the Pi is wired to the NeZha board
over I2C. [docs/setup/mac-to-raspberry-pi-access.md](docs/setup/mac-to-raspberry-pi-access.md)
covers how to reach it:

| Method | Use it for |
|---|---|
| **SSH** | Terminal work — `git`, `uv`, running the examples. The everyday default. |
| **[Raspberry Pi Connect](https://connect.raspberrypi.com)** | Reaching the Pi from outside your home network, through a browser. Free for personal use. |
| **VNC** | The graphical desktop over the local network. |
| **[Deskflow](docs/setup/deskflow-macos-raspberrypi.md)** | Sharing one keyboard and mouse across a Mac and a Pi on the same desk. |

### SSH Quick Reference (this build)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Username | `dannypi` |
| mDNS hostname | `danny-raspberrypi5-8gram-225gssd.local` |
| Current IP | `192.168.1.27` — DHCP assigned, can change; prefer the hostname |

Set up passwordless login once — run these **on the Mac** (enter the Pi password when prompted):

```bash
ssh-copy-id dannypi@danny-raspberrypi5-8gram-225gssd.local

cat >> ~/.ssh/config <<'EOF'

Host carpi
    HostName danny-raspberrypi5-8gram-225gssd.local
    User dannypi
EOF
```

After that, `ssh carpi` connects directly:

```bash
ssh carpi 'whoami && hostname -I'
```

Power health checks — run on the Pi (e.g. via `ssh carpi`):

```bash
vcgencmd get_throttled                # 0x0 = healthy; low nibble = throttling now, bits 16-19 = since boot
sudo vcgencmd pmic_read_adc EXT5V_V   # expect >= 4.8V when fed by the battery pack
```

Read the safety section before running anything remotely: the motor and servo scripts assume an
operator standing within reach of the main power switch.

The website includes both bilingual and English routes. Architecture notes are recorded in
[ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-static-site-architecture.md).

## Safety Notes

- The NeZha board must be powered from **12V**. Reversed polarity can destroy the board.
- If the board's `5V` rail powers the Raspberry Pi through `Pin 2` or `Pin 4`, do **not**
  connect USB-C power to the Raspberry Pi at the same time.
- Keep the I2C clock at or below **200kHz**. Raspberry Pi defaults to 100kHz, which is correct.
- Lift the car so all wheels are off the ground before the first motor test.
