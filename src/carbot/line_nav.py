"""State machine that turns a line reading into wheel commands.

Bottom layer (`carbot.line_follow.detect_line`) reports *where the line is*;
this module decides *what to do about it*: follow the line proportionally,
search when it disappears, and treat a persistent fork as a roundabout with a
time-confirmed lap before the car picks the exit branch.

The whole module is pure and unit-testable — no camera, no car, no I2C. It
emits :class:`NavCommand` values that the caller applies via `carbot.Car`
(``car.drive(command.left, command.right)``). Timing enters through ``dt``
(frames per second), so the same logic drives tests at any simulated rate.

Roundabout exit uses the agreed double confirmation: a fork (``junction``) is
needed **and** the elapsed time inside the roundabout must reach
``roundabout_loop_min_s``, which is anchored to the verified spin rate
(53.5 deg/s at speed 200, `examples/23_spin_rate_check.py`) — one full lap at
the calibrated speed takes ~6.7 s, so the default 6.5 s only counts a lap
that actually went around. Numbers stay tunable through :class:`NavPolicy`
and are expected to be adjusted against real runs.
