"""Downward-looking line detection for black-line tracking on the track map.

The camera is mounted pointing down at the floor, so the frame shows the
track map directly under the car plus a fixed band of chassis/shadow at the
bottom edge. A verified still (2026-08-15, 4056x3040, IMX500 AI Camera):

- track paper background peaks around gray 208
- the black line is ~2.3 % of the pixels and sits ~230 px wide
- any threshold in 90..120 separates line from paper (``dark_threshold``
  defaults to 100)
- the chassis/shadow band starts near y=2081 (68 % of the frame height) and
  the map edge shadows occupy the top ~8 %; the ROI excludes both by default
- the main line is chosen by width (about 2 cm), not by which dark strip
  spans the most ROI rows — chair legs and map-edge shadows otherwise win

The line is not assumed to be straight. Each scan row's dark-pixel centroid is
computed and the row centroids are combined with a median, which is robust to
branches, junctions, and the roundabout the car must trace. When too few rows
see a line the reading reports ``visible=False`` and ``error_px=None`` so the
controller can switch to a "search for the line" behaviour instead of steering
on garbage.

OpenCV is a Pi/`--extra vision` dependency, so it is imported lazily. This
module is pure: no camera, no motors, no I2C.

    ``error_px`` is the line centroid minus the frame centre in pixels:
    positive means the line is to the right of the car's heading, negative to
    the left. ``error_fraction`` normalises it to [-1, 1]. Both are ``None``
    when the line is not visible. ``centroid_x`` stays meaningful even when the
    reading is not visible, so a search behaviour can steer toward the last

    overlay can put the green cross on the line pixels instead of the ROI
    midpoint.
