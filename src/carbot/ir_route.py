"""The Task-1 junction sequence: what to do at each junction, and when one counts.

Why the sequence decides, and not the reading
---------------------------------------------
The first attempt keyed the action off the reading, with one ``in_roundabout`` boolean to
separate the two junctions that share a signature. The 2026-08-19 track run showed all three
of its premises were false:

* The T junction reached from the start-box stem reads ``1111``, not ``0111`` — the crossbar
  runs both east and west, so it is symmetric. ``1111`` was assumed unique to the roundabout
  entry, so the very first junction of the run set the flag the wrong way.
* The roundabout entry that run read ``0111``, not ``1111`` — the car arrived skewed. The two
  signatures the design leaned on had swapped places.
* The roundabout produced four more sustained ``1111`` events. "Re-synchronise on every
  ``1111``" only works if ``1111`` is rare, and it is the most common junction reading there is.

Result: six junction events, six right turns, zero of the straight-through crossings the route
needs. The reading simply does not carry enough information — the same local pattern means
"turn" in one place and "straight on" in another.

What does carry it is *where the car is in the lap*, and the route is fixed and known. So the
reading's only job here is "a junction is under the bar"; the action comes from the sequence,
and a distance gate rejects re-reads of the junction just handled. The gaps between junctions
differ by more than 6x, which is what makes a coarse distance estimate enough to hold the
sequence together.

2026-08-20, second pass: still failed, two more premises down
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the two-lap plan end to end on real hardware did not complete. Two more assumptions
this design still leaned on turned out false:

* **The roundabout exit's dwell timer never completed.** The exit produced ``0111``, ``1001``,
  ``1111`` and ``1110`` across the approach, in no fixed order. ``0111``/``1111``/``1110`` are
  ``Kind.JUNCTION`` and fed the dwell counter; ``1001`` is ``Kind.NOISE`` (not a signature one
  2cm line can produce) and was outside it. Every time a ``1001`` frame landed between
  qualifying ones, the dwell counter reset to zero. The sustained bar was real; the counter
  just never survived long enough to see it.
* **Steering did not stop just because a reading was junction-shaped.** Before the dwell timer
  finished (and, separately, whenever the distance gate rejected an early reading), the nav
  layer was still steering proportionally on the confirming reading's offset. That offset is
  derived from where a single straight 2cm line sits under the bar; it does not describe a
  roundabout exit curve or a T-junction crossbar, so correcting on it pulled the car off its
  approach before the route-driven turn/cross ever got to run.

2026-08-20, third pass: the dwell-on-any-reading model was wrong at the root
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both fixes above patched the *dwell* model (confirm on one qualifying reading, sustained for a
time threshold) without questioning whether "one reading, sustained" is what these junctions
actually produce. Direct signal tracing on the real track (operator watching the printed P1..P4
log line by line) showed it is not: every one of these junctions produces an **ordered sequence
of distinct readings**, several of which are not junction-shaped at all under
``carbot.ir_geometry``'s single-line model:

* **Roundabout exit**: ``0111 -> 0101 -> 0100 -> 0110``. ``0101`` is ``Kind.NOISE`` ("no single
  line can produce this") and ``0100``/``0110`` are ordinary ``Kind.DRIFT``/``Kind.ON_LINE``
  readings — indistinguishable from normal FOLLOW in isolation. Only the *order* they appear in
  is the real signal; a single-reading dwell check can never see this, no matter how the confirm
  set is widened.
* **Roundabout entry**: ``1111`` (1.5-1.8cm) -> ``1001`` (0.2cm) -> ``0000``. The same
  ``1111``-then-clear-to-``0000`` shape as the T junctions below, but with a distinctive
  ``1001`` shoulder in between that the plain T junctions do not produce.
* **Start-stem T junction**: ``1111`` (2cm) -> ``0000``.
* **The lap-crossing T junction (Phase 10 approach)**: a *different* sequence from the
  start-stem T, despite being the same physical junction — ``0111`` (not ``1111``) sustained
  2cm, then ``0110``. The stem approaches the T head-on (symmetric crossbar, reads ``1111``);
  Phase 10 approaches at the return leg's angle, off-centre (asymmetric, reads ``0111``). This
  also means, per this same real-track data, the lap-crossing case needs **no turn at all** to
  confirm arrival — reaching ``0110`` after the 2cm hold *is* arrival, immediately followed by
  the route-driven CROSS/STOP action.

``SequenceStep``/the ``approach`` field below replace ``confirm_signatures`` and the old
sustained-dwell timer with a small ordered state machine per junction: each step names the
physical reading expected and the minimum distance it must persist before the sequence trusts
it and advances. Distance gating (``min_cm_since_previous``) is unchanged and still runs as an
outer sanity check once a sequence completes — sequence-matching says *this looks like the
junction shape*, the gate still says *and we're far enough from the last one for that to be
believable*.

The turn itself also changes for the three junctions that do turn (the start-stem T, the
roundabout entry, and the roundabout exit): the same real-track tracing showed the turn ending
in a distinctive re-centring sequence (``0001 -> 0011 -> 0000 -> 0010 -> 0110``), so
``IRLineNav`` now turns closed-loop — watching for ``0110`` — instead of a pure timed spin. See
the ``IRLineNav._turn_step`` docstring for why this does not reintroduce the "any channel
visible" false-early-exit bug the original timed design was built to avoid.
