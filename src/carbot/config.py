"""Hardware mapping for the current car build.

## Confirmed from vendor documentation

1. **Motor port geometry on the back of the driver board**
   (`vendor/yourfun-nezha/wiring/1. NeZha-STM32小车整车接线图.pdf`, right-side diagram):

   ```
   M3 ┌───────────┐ M4
      │           │
   M2 └───────────┘ M1
   ```

2. **The servo header side (`S1 S2 S3 S4`) is the front of the car.**
   That side has the two white LEDs used as `HEADLED` in the command set. The opposite side carries
   the I2C header and the firmware/power status LEDs.

## Confirmed on real hardware

On 2026-07-30, `examples/02_motor_check.py` confirmed:
M1 = rear left, M2 = rear right, M3 = front right, M4 = front left.
M2 and M3 need inversion.
