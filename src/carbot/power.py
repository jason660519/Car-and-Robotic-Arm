"""Decoding for ``vcgencmd get_throttled`` power-health bits.

``examples/08_battery_check.py`` and ``examples/14_all_sensors_preflight_check.py`` each
decoded these bits inline, and both had the two halves inverted: the **low
nibble** carries the live state and **bits 16-19** carry the sticky
since-boot history. A ``0x50000`` reading — undervoltage and throttling *have
occurred* at some point since boot — was therefore reported as "throttling
NOW", failing the preflight and blocking motor tests on a supply that was
measuring a healthy 4.9 V. This module is the single decoder so the two
scripts cannot disagree again, and so the bit meanings are unit-tested
without a Raspberry Pi.

Bit layout, from the Raspberry Pi documentation:

| Mask | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ``0x1`` | undervoltage detected (live) |
| ``0x2`` | ARM frequency capped (live) |
| ``0x4`` | currently throttled (live) |
| ``0x8`` | soft temperature limit active (live) |
| ``0x10000`` | undervoltage has occurred since boot |
| ``0x20000`` | ARM frequency capping has occurred since boot |
| ``0x40000`` | throttling has occurred since boot |
| ``0x80000`` | soft temperature limit has occurred since boot |
