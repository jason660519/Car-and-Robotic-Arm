"""Measure the car's real spin rate and startup dead time, using the camera.

Turn angles have been open-loop from one measurement — 8.2 s per 360 deg at
speed 150, i.e. 43.9 deg/s — extrapolated to every speed and every angle. That
is good enough for random-bounce coverage. It is not good enough for a
photogrammetry sweep, which needs a burst of frames roughly 20 deg apart so
consecutive views overlap: a 20 deg step is under half a second of spin, and at
that scale the motor's startup transient is a large share of the motion.

This script commands a series of spin durations and measures what the car
actually did, by matching features between a frame taken before and after each
spin (:mod:`carbot.visual_yaw`). It then fits

    angle = rate * (duration - dead_time)

and prints the duration needed for a target step angle. No protractor and no
encoders — ADR 0002 ruled out measuring the robot by hand.

Durations are kept short on purpose: the lens covers about 66 deg, so a spin
past roughly 40 deg leaves too little overlap for the frames to be matched, and
the measurement would silently degrade instead of failing.

**Motor-moving.** An operator must stand beside the car able to cut main power
instantly. Run `examples/14_all_sensors_preflight_check.py` first. Directions alternate, so
the car oscillates around its starting heading instead of walking away — but
lift or secure the chassis if the space is tight.

    PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/23_cam_spin_rate_check.py --speed 200
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/23_cam_spin_rate_check.py --speed 150 --repeats 3

Point the car at a textured part of the room. A blank wall gives the matcher
nothing to work with; the script checks the first frame and says so.
