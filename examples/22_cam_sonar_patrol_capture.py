"""Autonomous patrol that avoids what the sonar cannot see, capturing for SfM.

A single forward HC-SR04 sees neither thin chair legs nor an overhead tabletop,
so `examples/17` drove under a chair and stuck on its underside. This patrol
fuses the IMX500's on-sensor object detection with the sonar through
:func:`carbot.vision_avoid.fuse`, and it captures 2028x1520 stills for COLMAP
from the **same camera configuration** — mode 'single', measured in
`docs/progress/2026-08-14-camera-modes-exposure-and-preflight-fix.md`, needs no
mode switching at all.

Per station: read the sonar and the latest detections, fuse them, then either
back up and turn away, or advance one short step. Every rotation is then stepped
in ~15 deg increments with a capture attempt at each stop — the avoidance turn
and the standing burst are the same sweep, differing only in how far they go and
whether the car rotates back afterwards.

This shape came from three hardware runs. Single frames per station did not
reconstruct: ten individually good frames (all sharp, all well exposed) formed
four disconnected islands when matched pairwise — 600-1500 matches within an
island, 10-40 between — and COLMAP registered 3 of 10, reporting "no good initial
image pair found". Adding a burst raised that to 17 of 30, and the remaining
breaks all sat on avoidance turns, which were dead time. Photographing through
the turn bridges those headings, since a 15 deg step keeps ~77% of the 66 deg
field of view in common, the upper end COLMAP wants indoors.

A weak link is also repaired during the run rather than discovered later on the
workstation: when a capture shares too few matches with the previous one, the car
rotates halfway back and inserts a bridging frame. That check is the same
`repeatable_keypoints` measurement that diagnosed the problem offline.

**The car has to cover ground, and it barely did.** Scale-anchoring a 30-frame
run put the entire trajectory inside 13 cm. Measured travel explains it: 0.117
m/s at speed 200, with reverse within 5% of forward, so a 0.6 s avoidance backup
handed back most of a 1.0 s step. Raising the PWM is a weak lever — doubling it
to 400 bought only 1.42x the speed — so the step lengthened instead, and to keep
a long step safe the forward travel is driven in segments with the fuse
re-evaluated between them. Turns still run at the calibrated `--spin-speed`,
because the 53.5 deg/s figure belongs to speed 200 and nothing else.

Each shot is also gated on being worth keeping. That gate exists because the
first supervised run kept frames shot 30 cm
from a whiteboard: sharp, correctly exposed, and 70% blank panel. Nothing was
blurred; the frames were simply useless to COLMAP. A capture is now rejected
when the sonar says the camera has no room in front (``--min-standoff-cm``) or
when :mod:`carbot.frame_quality` finds too few textured tiles. Rejected poses
cost a step, not a frame, so the saved set stays contiguous and every file in it
is worth matching. ``--max-steps`` bounds the run when a room rejects most poses.

The avoidance threshold is deliberately *not* raised to the standoff distance: a
45 cm turn threshold is what made an earlier patrol spin in place.

**Motor-moving.** An operator must stand beside the car able to cut main power
instantly. Run `examples/14_all_sensors_preflight_check.py` first.

    # stationary logic check — reads sensors, never drives
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/22_cam_sonar_patrol_capture.py --dry-run --frames 10

    # supervised run
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/22_cam_sonar_patrol_capture.py --frames 10
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/22_cam_sonar_patrol_capture.py --frames 150

Exposure defaults to `auto`. The stationary sweep in `examples/21` preferred spot
metering, but a patrol turns to face every direction, and spot metering blew out
43% of one frame when the car pointed at a window — the sweep never tested that
because the camera never moved. `spot` and `long-shutter-spot` remain available
for comparison. The 97 ms shutter blur risk that sweep left open is *resolved*:
at 38 ms with a 1.0 s settle, captures came back sharp while moving.
